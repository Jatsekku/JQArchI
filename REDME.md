# Purpose

[JQArchI](https://github.com/Jatsekku/JQArchI) is sets of bash scripts that bootstraps Arch Linux Instalation for my personal use.

## Rationale

There are many other Arch Installer Scripts/Helpers but I decided to create custom one that address my needs.
If you are interested in more general solution you should check
- https://github.com/classy-giraffe/easy-arch (higly inspired by this one)
- https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall


I was considering writing this little project in plain Python or use Arch Installer module but 
as my goal is **not** to create GP-solution, the bash script option seems more straigtforward and educational to me.\
Choosing Bash over Python also solves the problem of managing additional dependencies and 3rd party modules during the instalation.

## Runing scripts
TODO

Enjoy!
